# Holiday Mood Board

## Designate Page
This week, I am working on **index.html** for my Holiday Mood Board project.

## Required Techniques (Must Have)

1. **External CSS Style Sheet**: 
   - Created a separate CSS file named `style.css` to handle all styling for the page. This allows for better organization and maintainability of styles.

2. **Class Selector**: 
   - Utilized class selectors for styling the image gallery and quotes. For example, `.overlay-image` is used to style the images and `.quotes` for the quotes section.

3. **ID Selector**: 
   - The main title of the page is given an ID of `#main-title` for specific styling purposes.

## Additional Techniques

1. **Different Background Colors**: 
   - Set the body background color to a light vintage hue (`#f0e5d8`) to create a warm atmosphere.

2. **Different Font Colors**: 
   - Used contrasting colors for text to enhance readability and align with the vintage Christmas theme (e.g., dark red for general text and softer pinkish-red for quotes).

3. **Positioning**: 
   - The video is positioned absolutely to fill the width of the page while maintaining a height of `70vh`, ensuring it serves as a striking background element without compromising content visibility.

4. **Opacity**: 
   - The video background is set to `opacity: 0.5`, creating a semi-transparent effect that allows text and images to stand out.

5. **Text Alignment**: 
   - Centered the main title and adjusted the quotes section for better readability, providing a more organized layout.

6. **Quotes Background**: 
   - Added a light background to the quotes section to enhance visibility, using a soft white with some transparency.

## Summary of Techniques Applied
Throughout the project, I focused on creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional holiday mood board by integrating vibrant colors, text alignment, and thoughtful spacing for images and quotes. Each technique was carefully chosen to align with the vintage Christmas theme while ensuring usability and visual appeal.
