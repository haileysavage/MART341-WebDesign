## Techniques Used for Assignment 8

1. **Div (at least 2)**  
   I used `<div>` elements to structure the content on my pages effectively. For example:
   - On the `index.html` page, I grouped the main navigation links and the travel journal entries into separate divs to maintain layout clarity and make it easier to style these sections individually.
   - On the `activity.html` page, each activity is wrapped in its own `<div>` (class="activity-card") for easy styling and to allow for consistent spacing between activities.

2. **Span (at least 2)**  
   The `<span>` element was used to style smaller elements within larger text blocks:
   - On the `media.html` page, I used `<span>` tags to highlight the names of different media elements like audio and video titles.
   - On the `activity.html` page, I used `<span>` to emphasize key dates and activity descriptions, applying different styles within larger paragraphs without disrupting the flow.

3. **Audio (at least 1)**  
   I embedded an audio player on the `media.html` page:
   - The `<audio>` element was used to embed a background music track, allowing users to play the audio while browsing the site.
   - I used Spotify's embdedded playlist code to get the playlist onto my website allowing the user to play, pause, skip, and save.

4. **Video (at least 1)**  
   I included a travel video on the `media.html` page using the `<video>` element:
   - The video showcases a timelapse of the London Eye.
   - I used the `controls` attribute to enable users to play, pause, and adjust the volume.

5. **Iframe (at least 1)**  
   I used an `<iframe>` element to embed a map on the `activity.html` page:
   - This iframe displays a Google Map with the location of the Buckingham Palace.
   - The iframe allows users to explore the map without leaving the page, adding interactive functionality to the site.

6. **Class (at least 2)**  
   I created and applied CSS classes to style multiple elements:
   - On the `index.html` and `activity.html` pages, I used a class called `activity-card` to ensure all activity sections had a consistent appearance.
   - Another class, `media-box`, was applied to the divs containing each media element on the `media.html` page, keeping them organized and visually appealing.

7. **Escape character (at least 1)**  
   I used an escape character to include special characters within my text content:
   - On the `media.html` page, I used the escape code `&amp;` to display an ampersand in one of the image captions without breaking the HTML syntax.
   - This allowed for proper display of symbols within the text, ensuring accessibility and clarity.

## Conclusion
This assignment helped me understand how to use various HTML elements and techniques to structure, style, and enhance my travel blog. By employing divs for layout, spans for in-line styling, and media elements like audio, video, and iframes, I was able to create a visually appealing and interactive site. Additionally, using classes allowed for consistent design across different sections, while escape characters ensured proper display of special symbols.
