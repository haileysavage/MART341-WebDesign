### Techniques Used

#### Required Techniques
1. **External CSS Style Sheet**: Linked an external `style.css` for better maintainability.
2. **Hover Effects**: Added hover effects to images for interactivity, making images scale and change opacity slightly when hovered over.
3. **Self-Hosted Font**: Used a custom font stored in the `fonts` folder to maintain consistency across devices.
4. **External Font from a Library**: Incorporated *Playfair Display* from Google Fonts for the headers and quotes to create a vintage feel.

#### Additional Techniques
1. **Font Styles and Font-Weight**: Experimented with font-weight and styles to create a contrast between the body and headings, emphasizing important sections.
2. **Text Decoration and Pseudo-Elements**: Used a border effect as a decorative style on images, making them appear framed on hover.
3. **Spacing Adjustments**: Modified line height and padding for blockquotes and titles to enhance readability and visual appeal.
