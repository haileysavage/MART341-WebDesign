## Pages Worked On
- index.html

## Techniques Implemented

1. **Sizing:** Adjusted the size of award images to ensure a consistent width and height for better alignment and visual appeal.  
2. **Overflow:** Used `overflow: hidden` to manage content in the `.award-category` sections, ensuring clean boundaries for the design.  
3. **Border:** Added soft, festive-colored borders around award sections and the intro section to emphasize content and align with the holiday theme.  
4. **Margin:** Included margins to space out sections and avoid visual clutter.  
5. **Padding:** Increased padding inside the award sections for improved readability and visual balance.  
6. **Position:** Used relative positioning to align navigation links and ensure content layers cohesively.
