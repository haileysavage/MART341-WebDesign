## Travel Journal Website Idea

I’ve chosen to develop the Travel Journal idea because I love sharing my journeys with others. The calming and reflective tone I want to achieve will inspire users to explore the world through beautiful images and stories. I envision a simple, organized layout with a focus on visual content.

## Reflection

Adjusting the background color and width helped balance the content and make the page more readable. The light blue background created a calm and inviting tone, which complements the travel theme. I also used width to limit the container size, ensuring the page didn’t feel overcrowded.

Initially, I imagined a more complex layout, but simplifying the design allowed me to focus on readability and aesthetics. I did experiment with float and margin for images, which helped in positioning the images next to text without overwhelming the page.
