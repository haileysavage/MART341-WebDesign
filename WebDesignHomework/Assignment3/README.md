# Reflection on Web Development Cycle

## Understanding the Internet and URLs

In this cycle, I focused on deepening my understanding of **how the internet works** and the structure of URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). This was crucial for improving my web design skills, as understanding URLs helps in creating better, more user-friendly websites.

### Summary of Work
Throughout this cycle, I spent time learning about the anatomy of URLs, including components like the protocol, domain, path, query, and fragment. I also explored how these elements are used in web development to ensure proper linking and accessibility of web resources. 

I chose to prioritize learning about URL encoding and decoding because it was an area I had little experience in. This knowledge will help when handling special characters in URLs, ensuring they are properly formatted for browsers to interpret.

### Challenges and Solutions
One of the challenges I faced was understanding the complexities of URL encoding. Initially, I struggled with encoding spaces and special characters, but I solved this by diving into more detailed documentation and practicing with real-world examples. Using online tools for encoding also helped me visualize how URLs are transformed.

### Key Learnings
An important concept I would like to discuss further is **how to optimize URLs for search engines (SEO)**. I learned that clean, descriptive URLs improve user experience and search rankings, but I’m still curious about the deeper technical aspects of URL optimization for performance.

*Here’s a quick breakdown of what I learned*:
- How the internet transmits data using protocols like HTTP and HTTPS.
- The importance of URL structure in web design.
- The role of URL encoding in handling special characters.
- Basic SEO practices for URLs.
